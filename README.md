# system-endpoint-enumeration
Terminal-based identification and security baseline analysis of an undocumented laptop, covering operating system, kernel, shell, user context, network interfaces, and physical and wireless attack surfaces.

# System Enumeration & Security Baseline

## Scenario

An unknown laptop was provided with no documentation.
The objective was to use terminal-based techniques to identify the system,
its operating environment, and any connected devices in order to establish
a security baseline before further security analysis.

This methodology is platform-agnostic and can be applied to any computer
system (macOS, Linux, or Windows) using native OS tools.

## Objectives

- Identify the operating system, kernel, and hardware architecture
- Identify the active shell and user privilege context
- Enumerate network connectivity and exposure
- Identify physical (USB) and wireless (Bluetooth) attack surfaces
- Detect unauthorised or foreign devices that could pose a security risk
